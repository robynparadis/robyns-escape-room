    <h1 class="redteam">Hi, Red Team!</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to Sylvan Lake</h2>
      
        <p>
            Welcome to the game.

            Thank you for being part of my 31st birthday, and for spending yet another year with me on our annual cabin trips. It means more than you know.
            <br><br>
            But this year, things are... different.
            
            The puzzles ahead were made with me in mind. Knowing how I think will help you. But don't rely on that alone ‚Äî wit, instinct, and cleverness will be just as vital.
            <br><br>
            Some clues will feel familiar. Others‚Ä¶ might not.
            <br><br>
            Good luck.
           
            You're going to need it.
        </p>
