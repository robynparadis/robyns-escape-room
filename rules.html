    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Only take your team's envelope at any clue location. Taking, moving, or destroying another team's envelope will result in a disqualification. Envelopes will be marked with your team's color.</li>
        <li>Use stealth when discussing any part of the game. The other team may be on the same section as you, and you could give away an answer they may not have yet.</li>
        <li>You may go to Josh at any point for a hint to any puzzle. The more hints, the more we will make fun of your team after the game is over, and for the rest of our friendship.</li>
    </ol>
