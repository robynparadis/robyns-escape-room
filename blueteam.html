    <h2>Welcome to Sylvan Lake</h2>
      
        <p>
          Welcome to the game.

          Thank you for being part of my 31st birthday, and for spending another year with me on our annual cabin trip. It means more than you know.
          <br><br>
          But this year, things are a bit different.
          
          The puzzles ahead were made with me in mind. Knowing about lil 'ol me will help you to move quickly. But instincts, cleverness, and having paid attention to your surroundings over the past couple of days will help just as much.
          <br><br>
          Some clues will feel familiar. Others might not, until you unlock further information.
          <br><br>
          Good luck.
         
          You're going to need it.
        </p>

        <p class="good-info">
          To unlock your first clue, <br>go to the <strong>patio set outside</strong>. ‚õ±Ô∏è
